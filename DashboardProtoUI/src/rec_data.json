        "description": "CLIENT should identify and implement comprehensive network monitoring and logging tools that will support CLIENT and operational practices.  CLIENT should ensure that logs generated from the corporate infrastructure are stored on an independently secure, separate, central logging solution to secure system and network event logs. This could be achieved by implementing a SIEM solution across key components of the network. CLIENT should define, implement, and tune monitoring and auditing rules within this solution to detect abnormal activity within the corporate environment, especially those actions that could indicate unauthorised or inappropriate access/use of the corporate network and/or privilege escalation.",

These documents are designed to be specific to certain types of security incidents (i.e. ransomware, malware, lost or stolen device, etc.).  Playbooks should provide step-by-step processes for responding to incidents that will allow incident responders to act and contain and eradicate the threat as quickly as possible",
